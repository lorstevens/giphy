# giphy
In this assignment I worked with the GIPHY API for the first time.

I initially created an array of television shows, which I appended to buttons. When a user clicks on a button, 10 related, unique GIFs with their Rating prepend to the page. I did this by calling the AJAX method, looping the response date, then prepending to the page using JQuery. 

I also created a dynamic Click function and conditional statement that allows users to animate and pause the displayed GIFs. 

Lastly, I added an input that allows users to search for any television-show GIF. When the user clicks submit, the search input is pushed to a button on the page.
