An television-themed application built using the Giphy API. 


 ### Purpose ###
 When a user clicks on a button, 10 related Gifs will render on the page. Each Gif will animate once clicked (and stop animating once clicked again).
 Users can also add their own buttons should they want to view different Gifs.
